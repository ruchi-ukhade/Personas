        <!-- Sarah Section -->
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Sarah</h3>
                <div class="regular-text">Sarah uses the microwave regularly and has her routine down to muscle memory—she always heats her food for two minutes because she knows it’ll be warm enough. She doesn’t have any trouble using it since it works the same as the one she has at home. The only real issue for her is cleanliness—if it’s too messy, she’ll head upstairs to use a different one.</div>

            <div class="content">
                <h3>Natalia</h3>
                <div class="regular-text">Natalia uses the microwave often and knows exactly how to operate it without any trouble. She always checks for cleanliness first, and if it’s too dirty—or if there are ants—she’ll head upstairs to use the student lounge microwave instead. After some trial and error, she’s settled on a routine of heating her food for a minute, stirring, and then heating it again for the best results. While she has no issues with how the microwave works, she does get frustrated with how rarely it’s cleaned.</div>

        <!-- Jason Section -->
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Jason</h3>
                <div class="regular-text">Jason was using the microwave for the first time and felt uncertain about how it worked, mainly due to the unfamiliar button layout. He wasn’t sure whether he needed to manually enter the time or if it would start automatically, so he ended up just pressing "Start." He chose this microwave because it was close to his work studio where he was working that day. As he used it, he tried to figure out the buttons and initially kept the lid on his food for cleanliness but removed it midway to release pressure. Jason found the lack of clear instructions and feedback from the microwave frustrating. He expected some response when pressing buttons but got none.</div>

            <h3>Confused Camron</h3>
            <div class="regular-text">Camron is a first-time user who struggles with the unfamiliar interface and lacks clear guidance. He faces issues with the unclear button layout, the lack of feedback when pressing buttons, and confusion over how to input cooking time. Camron represents users who are unfamiliar with the microwave and may feel frustrated by an unintuitive design and lack of user support.</div>
